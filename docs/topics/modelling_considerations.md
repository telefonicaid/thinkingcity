# Tips on how to model your project entities with the ThinkingCity Platform

There are some considerations to make when designing how to model a project in the platform. This document will give you
some hints to avoid most common mistakes (use them as hints to guide your modelling, not as strict rules).

## The ThinkingCity Platform is centered in context

The central piece of the ThinkingCity Platform is the Context Broker: a component that lets you store and query information
about context entities. But, what is a Context Entity? Context Entities are logical abstractions that represent the elements
of your system. Some examples are:

* If you are modelling a Smart City, you may have entities like: Streetlight, Garden, Bus, Street, RecycleBin...
* Modelling a Industry you may find useful entities like: Worker, Machine, Product, and so on.
* When designing a Smart Parking you will have entities like: Car, User, Floor...

What does it mean that those objects are Context Entities (instead of classes, objects, tables, or documents). The
difference lays in how it is treated around the platform: modifications of the CEs can be observed by subscriptions,
the history of those changes stored at [persistence backends](../cygnus.md), like MySQL,
rules can be defined to modify the global Context based on CEs changes with [CEP](../cep.md)...

All the given examples have several things in common:

* All of them model nouns: Context Entities are subjects of interactions; they have a history, they may have subscriptions
to their changes, etc. This behavior does not fit well with processes (and things typically modelled as verbs or actions).

* All those entities are expected to have a long life in the system. Entities are not supposed to model
transient information (e.g.: support tickets, mails, log files). This doesn't mean short-lived entities can't be modelled
in the system, but having those kind of entities in your project will cause several operational issues in the platform.

## The Platform is not a ticketing system

Another common mistake involves the use of the Platform for short-lived ticketing, as in the following scenarios:

* A system that keeps track of alarms risen by sensors, and whether they have been solved or not. Modelled entities are:
Sensor and Alarm.

* A booking system for Theater seats, modelling each ticket as a Context Entity. Modelled entities are: Seat and Ticket.

In both cases there is a Context Entity that does not comply with the above rules about Context Entities: Ticket and Alarm.
Both entities model short lived elements that will be created once and again in the system, cluttering your service with
old information.

Objects like tickets, even being nouns, model interactions between entities in your system instead of modelling contextual
elements: a ticket is a temporal association between a user (that may go once and again to the same theater) and the seat
(where he will be seated in a particular play). A more convenient way to model this kind of information would be to
directly code it in the seat, as in the following example (NGSIv1):

      {
         "type": "Seat",
         "isPattern": "false",
         "id": "Row12SeatB",
         "attributes": [
           {
             "name": "status",
             "type": "String",
             "value": "occupied"
           },
           {
             "name": "play",
             "type": "String",
             "value": "Richard III"
           },
           {
             "name": "audience",
             "type": "Person",
             "value": {
                "name": "Bob Smith"
             }
           }
         ]
      }

or the same entity in NGSIv2 format:

      {
         "type": "Seat",
         "id": "Row12SeatB",
         "status": {
             "type": "String",
             "value": "occupied"
         },
         "play": {
             "type": "String",
             "value": "Richard III"
         },
         "audience": {
             "type": "Person",
             "value": {
                "name": "Bob Smith"
           }
         }
      }

With this modelling, the Context Broker will be storing the actual picture of the Theater: which seats have been sold and
which seats haven't. The history of each seat could also be made available (by means of the STH and other history
persistence backend), giving information of past plays. And all that, following the performance and modelling
recommendations.

This approach has some caveats, though:

* It cannot model future events (not easily, at least). Modelling future purchases for the same seat for diferent days
could be difficult in this situation.

* It doesn't allow to interact with past events (once again, not easily). If some of the information in the seat could be
 modified (e.g.: ratings by the audience, or payment receipt information) for past seats, it wouldn't be possible. The same
 goes for an alarm that was raised multiple times, if some new information arrives about a past alarm notification.

For all those situations where this kind of model cannot fit your problem, you may consider to manage that part of your
problem externally, through a ticketing system, or a specialized backend. The IoTPlatform offers multiple ways to
link your data in external systems with data in the platform, so you can still benefit from the Platform features, while
using specialized tools for particular processes (like support or purchases).

## Attributes are not collections

A commmon mistake when a beginner is modelling a problem in the Platform is: to see the structure of a Context Entity
(i.e.: objects with an identity that have collections of other objects, the attributes, that have names and values) (NGSIv1):

      {
         "type": "SensorMachine",
         "isPattern": "false",
         "id": "machine1",
         "attributes": [
           {
             "name": "attr1",
             "type": "String",
             "value": "val1"
           },
           {
             "name": "attr2",
             "type": "String",
             "value": "val2"
           },
           {
             "name": "attr3",
             "type": "String",
             "value": "val3"
           }
         ]
      }

or the same entity in NGSIv2 format:

      {
         "type": "SensorMachine",
         "id": "machine1",
         "attr1": {
             "type": "String",
             "value": "val1"
         },
         "attr2": {
             "type": "String",
             "value": "val2"
         },
         "attr3": {
             "type": "String",
             "value": "val3"
         }
      }

and think that it will fit any model that has an object containing a list of things, like the following one:

      {
         "type": "DepartmentWorkers",
         "isPattern": "false",
         "id": "RRHH",
         "attributes": [
           {
             "name": "Bob",
             "type": "User",
             "value": {
                "name": "Bob",
                "surname": "Smith",
                "ID": "3456"
             }
           },
           {
             "name": "Alice",
             "type": "User",
             "value": {
                "name": "Alice",
                "surname": "Johnson",
                "ID": "8744"
             }
           }
         ]
      }

or the same entity in NGSIv2 format:

      {
         "type": "DepartmentWorkers",
         "id": "RRHH",
         "Bob": {
             "type": "User",
             "value": {
                "name": "Bob",
                "surname": "Smith",
                "ID": "3456"
             }
         },
         "Alice": {
             "type": "User",
             "value": {
                "name": "Alice",
                "surname": "Johnson",
                "ID": "8744"
             }
         }
      }

This is a wrong model for this problem for several reasons:

* First of all, the querying and subscription features of the Context Broker are based on the hypothesis that each of your
model entities is going to be implemented as an independent Context Entity. Grouping information inside other entities
would end up in cumbersome queries and subscription logic (and it may even make impossible to execute some queries or
subscriptions).

* It is also a problem due to performance factors. The performance of some operations depend on the number of attributes
of the involved CEs. Making CEs with ever-growing number of attributes may end up damaging the performance of your project.

* It is also worth mentioning that there are physical limits to the size of entities in the Context Broker, so
evergrowing entities may not be possible to model, depending on their size.

Another scenario where we could find the same modelling problem would be the aforementioned Theater scenario. In that
scenario we could have thought that a nice model could be having a Theater Context Entity like the following (NGSIv1):

      {
         "type": "Theater",
         "isPattern": "false",
         "id": "LondonShakespeareTheater",
         "attributes": [
           {
             "name": "1-A",
             "type": "Seat",
             "value": {
                "status": "Occupied",
                "name": "Bob Smith"
             }
           },
           {
             "name": "1-B",
             "type": "Seat",
             "value": {
                "status": "Free"
             }
           },
           {
             "name": "1-C",
             "type": "Seat",
             "value": {
                "status": "Occupied",
                "name": "Alice Johnson"
             }
           },

           [...]
         ]
      }

or the same entity in NGSIv2 format:

      {
         "type": "Theater",
         "id": "LondonShakespeareTheater",
         "1-A": {
             "type": "Seat",
             "value": {
                "status": "Occupied",
                "name": "Bob Smith"
             }
         },
         "1-B": {
             "type": "Seat",
             "value": {
                "status": "Free"
             }
         },
         "1-C": {
             "type": "Seat",
             "value": {
                "status": "Occupied",
                "name": "Alice Johnson"
             }
           },

         [...]
      }


This scenario has the same problems as the department worker scenario above. It would be best to model each of the Seats
as a Context Entity by itself, and model de Theater, either as a subservice holding all the information about the seats,
or as a sepparete Context Entity, having a link with their seats (through an attribute in the seat).
