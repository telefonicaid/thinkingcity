# <a name="top"></a>Which historical backend should I use?

The ThinkingCity Platform provides several backends where historical datasets related to real-time context information can be created and maintained. Among these backends we can find:

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), a highly scalable NoSQL database used for large-scale historical storage.

Given this variety of backends, the key question is: which one best suits my use case? This usually depends on the following variables:

* **Amount of data**. If you can estimate the volume of data in the short, medium, and long term, this will be one of the most relevant decisions.
* **Privacy considerations**. Maybe your data can be made public as Open Data; or not.
* **Desired analysis**. The main goal of storing data is to analyze it to obtain valuable information.
* **Visualization tools**. Closely related to the above, graphical tools are useful when handling large volumes of information.

A fifth variable could be whether the backend allows **static data loading**, meaning uploading other datasets independent from the real-time contextual data.

Letâ€™s look at each option from these perspectives.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is currently the preferred solution for large-scale historical persistence, replacing the old systems based on Hadoop/HDFS. As a document-oriented NoSQL database, it allows managing massive volumes of data with high efficiency and horizontal scalability.

This backend is ideal if you handle large amounts of historical data. Moreover, MongoDB is flexible in terms of data schema, which makes it easier to adapt to changes in input formats without redesigning structures.

Regarding analysis, although MongoDB does not provide visual analytics tools by itself, it allows executing complex aggregate queries through its aggregation framework, or easily integrating with external tools such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/), among others.

In terms of privacy, MongoDB manages access through roles and authentication at the collection and database level, allowing fine-grained control over permissions.

MongoDB also supports **static data loading**, so you can integrate your own datasets (e.g., historical records, catalogs, etc.) and analyze them along with the data generated by the ThinkingCity Platform.
