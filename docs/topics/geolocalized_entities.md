# Entities geolocalization

The platform allows entities geolocalization. In other words, entities may have an attribute which 
value is interpreted as the entity location, among the following types:

- A point, e.g. to model a Car entity which moves across a city.
- A line, e.g. to model a Street entity
- A polygon with an arbitrary number of vertex, e.g. to model a city neighborhood
- An arbitrary [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org)

Entities location is managed through the [Data API](../data_api.md) exposed by [Context Broker](../context_broker.md). See details at "Geospacial properties of entities" section at the [NGSIv2 specification](http://telefonicaid.github.io/fiware-orion/api/v2/stable/). The following example
shows how to set a `location` attribute for a given entity (which id is `Tenerife`) and which roughly corresponds to the Tenerife island surface
on Earth:

    PATCH /v2/entities/Tenerife/attrs/location
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "value": [ "28.362, -16.883", "28.003, -16.693", "28.552, -16.136", "28.520, -16.418", "28.396, -16.641", "28.362, -16.883" ]
      "type": "geo:polygon"
    }


With regards with entities corresponding to devices connected to the platform and managed by [IoT Agents](../device_gateway.md), you can
geo-locate them as `geo:point` using the model transformation functionality. Let's assume the same scenario shown in the [notifications scenario](how_notifications_work.md).
Sensor information can be reported either directly in the `latitude, longitude` format, or separately, by using expressions to combine the information
into a geo point. To do so, the car provisioning should be changed to reflect this new information. If the sensor information is sent using :

    POST /iot/groups
    Content-Type: application/json
    Fiware-service: smartown
    Fiware-servicepath: /roads

    {
      "groups": [
        {
          "protocol": [
                  "IoTA-UL"
                ],
          "apikey": "801230BJKL23Y9090DSFL123HJK09H324HV8732",
          "entity_type": "Car",
          "attributes": [
            {
              "object_id": "s",
              "name": "speed",
              "type": "Number"
            },
            {
              "object_id": "la",
              "name": "latitude",
              "type": "Integer"
            },
            {
              "object_id": "lo",
              "name": "longitude",
              "type": "Integer"
            },
            {
              "name": "location",
              "type": "geo:point",
              "expression": "${latitude}, ${longitude}"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

With this configuration, information from the car can be reported with the following request:

    POST /iot/d?k=801230BJKL23Y9090DSFL123HJK09H324HV8732&i=BCZ6754
    Content-Type: text/plain

    s|55|la|40.392|lo|-3.759

This will generate an update request to the context broker, setting the value of the attribute `location` to the value
`40.392, -3.759`, as defined by the expression.

Once the entities location is correctly configured, it can be exploited at different platform points. In particular:

- At the Data API, through geographical queries (both synchronous such as
  `GET /v2/entities` or asynchronous as part of a subscription filter). See "Geographical Queries" section at the [NGSIv2 specification](http://telefonicaid.github.io/fiware-orion/api/v2/stable/). For example, in order to get all the Car devices 15 km close to the Madrid city center the
  following query could be used.

        GET /v2/entities?type=Car&georel=near;maxDistance:15000&geometry=point&coords=40.418889,-3.691944 
        Fiware-service: smartown
        Fiware-servicepath: /roads

- At the [CEP API](../cep_api.md). CEP is able to process entity point locations
  (other shapes as line, polygon, etc. not yet supported) so its latitude and
  longitude can be easily used in EPL conditions. See [CEP documentation](https://github.com/telefonicaid/perseo-fe/blob/master/documentation/plain_rules.md#location-fields) for more detail. For example, the following rule will send an email when the entity with attribute `location` is 
  less than 5 km far away from Cuenca. It uses the circle equation, `(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = d^2`, being (a, b) 618618.8286057833 and 
  9764160.736945232 the UTMC coordinates of Cuenca and d the distance of 5000 m.
