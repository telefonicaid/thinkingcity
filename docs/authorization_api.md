Authorization API allows you to create, assign and retrieve grants for users of ThinkingCity platform.

# Grants

Grants are a kind of subservices (keystone projects) which can imply for a user that has any role in that subservice a permission for do something in an application built on top of ThinkingCity platform.


Grants always start with a '#' character, in contrast to other subservices which start without that character.

Some examples of grants could be: `#readerApp`, `#adminApp`, `#managerApp` and so on.

There is a complete description about grants for [Urbo2](https://github.com/telefonicasc/urbo2/blob/master/docs/grants.md)


# Create Grants

Grants, like other subservices (keystone project), can be created using [Management API for create subservice](https://thinkingcity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/management_api.html#create-subservice)

Morever, like others subservices, can be created using Administration Portal of ThinkingCity platform.


# Assign Grants

To assign a grant to a user, a role should be assigned to a user in that grant (keystone project) using [Management API for assign role to user](https://orchestrator2.docs.apiary.io/#reference/orchestrator/user-role-assigment/assign-role-to-user)

Morever, like others role assigments, can be performed using Administration Portal of ThinkingCity platform.


# Get Grants

There is an API to retrieve all grants (aka keystone project roles) for a user:


```
GET /v3/users/{user_id}/project_roles HTTP/1.1
Host: <idm_host>:<idm_port>

```

This call uses a x-auth-token associated to <user_id> user.
You will receive an HTTP 200 OK response like this:

```
